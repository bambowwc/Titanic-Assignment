## Titanic CSPC Assignment

## What the Project is about? 
* The project is about using the famous Titanic Dataset to determine if the survival of travellers on the vessel was based on several factors ranging from sex, age, class which was determined by the ticket purchased, embarkment location.
## Why this Project?
* The objective of this project is to use python in performing exploratory data analysis for confirmation of the factors that contributed to those that survived the disaster.
##Result
* 3 key factors were considered to have contributed mainly to those that survived; Age, Sex and Class.
* * Age - Plots made confirmed children survived in comparison to adults.
* * Class - I consider as the major factor, as those in lower class had fewer chances of survival based on the part of the deck they were lodged. And this was corroborated in the chart.
* * Sex - number of surviving females was higher than that of males, as the rule to safety was women and children first, and this was also corroborated based on the histogram plot.
